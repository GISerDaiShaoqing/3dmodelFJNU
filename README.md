## Open data set
We provided the shapefile of each building in Fujian Normal University and 3D model of Fujian Normal University. You could visit and explore the 3D model in [this url](http://www.arcgis.com/apps/CEWebViewer/viewer.html?3dWebScene=763aa7b8bf7e4f0985eeb19c2fa34f7a). The public participant GIS system could be found in [ArcGIS online](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=763aa7b8bf7e4f0985eeb19c2fa34f7a). This work was funded by the Project-The Technological Innovation Plan of University Students, Fujian Normal University, "The Optimization Model of High Education Staff’s Refuge Space Under Earthquake Disater"(cxxl-2014137). I'm the principal investigator(PI) of this project.
