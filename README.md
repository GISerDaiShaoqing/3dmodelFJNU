## Open data set
We provided the shapefile of each building in Fujian Normal University and 3D model of Fujian Normal University(.3ws is the City Engine export Scence data format). You could visit and explore the 3D model in [this url](http://www.arcgis.com/apps/CEWebViewer/viewer.html?3dWebScene=763aa7b8bf7e4f0985eeb19c2fa34f7a). The public participant GIS system could be found in [ArcGIS online](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=763aa7b8bf7e4f0985eeb19c2fa34f7a). This work was funded by the Project-The Technological Innovation Plan of University Students, Fujian Normal University, "The Optimization Model of High Education Staff’s Refuge Space Under Earthquake Disater"(cxxl-2014137). I'm the principal investigator(PI) of this project.
